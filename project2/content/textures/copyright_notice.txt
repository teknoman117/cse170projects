Copyright Notice for Texture Assets in Project 2

These textures came with the right for me (the developer) to include with distributions of my application.  These textures are the property of their respective owners.  

You are granted the right to use these textures as a component of my application (project 2), but you may NOT extract them for use in your own applications.

Since pretty much all resources for any game can be extracted these days (Unity assets are LZMA archives and the source code for Unreal PAK is available as a component of UE4), if someone is going to steal textures they are going to steal them.  Doesn't matter if its some PNGs in a github repo or bundled into a game, the difficulty is not that high...
